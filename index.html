        <div class = 'about-text'>
            <p>I recently graduated from the University of Durham in Natural Sciences, with my degree mainly consisting of Physics and Philosophy. In my second year I had my first exposure to Computer Science and found a natural aptitude and passion. </p>
            <p>Since graduating, I have completed the School of Code Bootcamp,where I have grown comfortable with fast paced learning environments, working collaboratively as a team, and adapting to new frameworks quickly.</p>
            <p>With these skills I have been able to expand my tech-stack and solve problems using business and consumer perspectives.
